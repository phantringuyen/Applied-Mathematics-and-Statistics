# Color Compression

- In this project, we will understand how to store an image with a large size, for it is necessary to store the storage size in the corresponding PC memory.
- So we need to reduce the number of colors of the image to a certain number of primary colors while keeping the image content as preserved as possible.

File **Report.pdf** will detail the methods of the K-means algorithm on Color Compression.
